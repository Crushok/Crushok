**Digital Craftsman (Developer/Filmmaker/Creator)**

I'm a dynamic IT professional with over a decade of experience in technical support, community engagement, IT management, and web development across various sectors. Adept at leading teams and managing customer-centric programs, I bring a strategic approach to problem-solving and process improvement. My expertise extends from hardware and software troubleshooting to developing user engagement strategies, all underpinned by a strong foundation in IT management and customer service excellence. I am looking to expand into back-end development.
